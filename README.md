    Image Enhancement: The bot uses advanced algorithms to improve image quality, offering a cleaner, higher-resolution output.
    Fast Response: The bot processes and returns the enhanced image in a short time, making it efficient and user-friendly.

Technology Stack

    Python: The core programming language used for backend development.
    Aiogram: A powerful and efficient framework for building Telegram bots in Python.
    Image Enhancement Libraries: The bot uses image enhancement algorithms and techniques to upgrade image quality.

How It Works

    User sends a low-quality image to the bot via Telegram.
    The bot processes the image using enhancement algorithms.
    The enhanced, higher-quality image is returned to the user.

Purpose
